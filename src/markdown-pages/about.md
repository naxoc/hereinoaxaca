We are  an American/Danish couple (Addi and Camilla, respectively) who live permanently in Copenhagen, Denmark, but winter in Oaxaca, Mexico. We became enamoured with Oaxaca when we visited on a vacation trip, and fell completely in love with it the first winter we lived here. This site shares our experience and answers common questions that we get. Mexico is a vast and beautiful country, and Oaxaca is our favorite jewel. We're sharing our experience with the intention to both entice people to visit and explore this wonderful region of Mexico, as well as provide some guidance for what to expect when you do visit and make the most of your trip. Most of location-specific information on this site is focused on Oaxaca de Juaréz (Oaxaca City), which is the capital of Oaxaca state. The city and the state are both normally just refered to as Oaxaca, which can be confusing. We also visit other areas of Oaxaca state and other regions of Mexico, but our main focus is very much Oaxaca City.

You should keep in mind that this site reflects our perspective and shouldn't be viewed as comprehensive. Here are a few contextual things to clarify some of our perspectives:

- We only live in Mexico for 2–3 months of the year, and that time is during the winter (January, February, March).
- We're 2 women in our 40s.
- We are in the fortunate position of being able to work from anywhere with a good internet connection, so we are working full time and enjoying Oaxaca in our free time.

 If you have questions about visiting, or living in, Oaxaca or Mexico, we'd love to hear them.
