One of the things I love most about Mexico is the food and drink. I never get bored with Mexican cuisine.

##Oaxacan Specialities

Oaxaca is a prime target for people who love food and drink. I would even say that it is the best culinary capital in Mexico outside of Mexico City. Like all regions of Mexico, you can get a wide variety of Mexican dishes, but there is also a distinct local food culture that sets it apart from other areas of the country. The different regions of Oaxaca state each have their own specialities and indigenous influence. With Oaxaca City being in Valles Centrales, the city takes a lot of influence from the local central Zapotec communities, although there is also a blend of Mixtec from the west and the Isteme√±o Zapotec from the east. In addition to exploring the local cuisine, there are also just a good number of really great restaurants in the city run by some of the top chefs in Mexico.

There is a whole set of typical Oaxacan food to choose from. The most well-known Oaxacan dish is probably the tlayuda, which some people refer to as a Mexican pizza.

In addition to dishes, most people associate Oaxaca with grasshoppers (chapulines) in the cuisine, Oaxacan string cheese (quesillo)

For drinking, to start with non-alcoholic, you'll find that Oaxaca specializes in drinks from the family of cacao plants. In addition to a very strong tradition of drinking chocolate you will also find **tejate**, made with flor de cacao, a tree that is in the same family as the chocolate tree but quite different altogther, and **[chocolateatole](/atole)**, which is not your normal atole in that it uses a another, closer chocolate relative called white cacao or petaxte.

On the alcohol side, Oaxaca is famous around the world for mezcal. Mezcal is a distilled liquor made from the agave. Tequila is technically just 1 kind of mezcal that is made from a specific variety of agave and has regional and production restrictions for its name. Mezcal is also controlled regionally these days and while there are many Mexican states producing it now, Oaxaca is still considered the primary producer. You'll find a lot of opportunities to try hundreds of varieties in Oaxaca, in addition to a plethora of cocktails based on mezcal. There is also a low alchol, non-distilled agave beverage called pulque, which is popular in Oaxaca as well. Aside from its famous agave beverages, Oaxaca is also producing some nice craft beers, with several local breweries.
