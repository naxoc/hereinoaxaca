Oaxaca has something for everyone. The state has the most biodiversity and cultural diversity of all the Mexican states and there is a full range of activities, which I break down into 4 main groups: History, Culture, Food and Drink, and Nature. A great source of information about what is going on around the city on any given day is [Qué Pasa Oaxaca](http://www.quepasaoaxaca.com/eventos-para-hoy-todays-events/).

## Oaxaca City top 5
These are the top 5 things that I recommend everyone do if you have time. The first 2 are classic tourist sites, and the other 3 are just recommendations for getting a feel for the city and surrounding area, as we see it at least.

### 1. Monte Alban


### 2. Botanical Garden tour


### 3. Go to a market


### 4. Spend time on the Zócalo
Every Mexican town, no matter the size, has a zócalo, or town square. Find your way over there and do some people watching. The evenings and weekends are particularly fun. You can park yourself at one of the many restaurants that ring it or just wander around and grab a bench. In the evenings you can grab some street food, from hamburgers to corn (esquites and elotes) and watch the kids playing. Sometimes on weekends there may also be a concert or some other interesting activity on the square. All times of day there will be musicians playing for the restaurant patrons, as well as a wealth of hawkers selling all kinds of wares.

### 5. Get out of the city
It's always great to get some perspective on a city by getting out of it and into a smaller town or natural area nearby. Oaxaca provides a bunch of opportunities for this, either through the many tours offered or on your own. One of the easiest trips to make is to go to the nearby town of Tule (Santa Maria del Tule). It's a cute little town with a landmark in the [Tule Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rbol_del_Tule), which is the largest tree (by girth) in the world. It's about a 30-minute drive to the east of Oaxaca City. Take a look at a category of activity that you're interested in and see what kinds of things are happening outside the city proper and experience more of Oaxaca.
