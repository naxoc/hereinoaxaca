Oaxaca has something for everyone. The state has the most biodiversity and cultural diversity of all the Mexican states and there is a full range of activities, which I'm going to break down into 4 main groups: History, Culture, Food and Drink, and Nature.

## Oaxaca City top 5
These are the top 5 things that I recommend everyone do if they have time. The first 2 are classic tourist places, and the other 3 are just recommnedations for getting a feel for the city. They give you a good overall feel for the city and surrounding area, as we see it at least.

### 1. Monte Alban


### 2. Botanical Garden tour


### 3. Go to a market


### 4. Spend time on the ZÃ³calo


### 5. Get out of the city
It's always great to get some perspective on a city by getting out of it and into a smaller town or natural area nearby. Oaxaca provides a bunch of opportunities for this, either through the many tours offered, or on your own. One of the easiest trips to make is to go to the nearby town of Tule (Santa Maria del Tule). It is a cute little town with a landmark in the [Tule Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rbol_del_Tule), which is the largest tree (by girth) in the world. It's about a 30-minute drive to the east of Oaxaca City.
