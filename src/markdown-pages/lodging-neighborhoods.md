While there are a ton of neighborhoods (barrios and colonias) in Oaxaca, there are only a handful that I'm familiar with and that most tourists end up living and spending time in. 

Centro Histórico
The center of Oaxaca makes up, by far, the largest "neighborhood" here. There are no official designations within its borders to break things into smaller areas, but most people speak of areas of Centro by the major landmarks, the zócalo and Santo Domingo, or the main north/south divide of Avenida de la Independencia (which is also the border where most north/south street names change). The zócalo is south and Santo Domingo is north.	

Barrio de La Noria
This neighborhood is tucked into the southwest corner of Centro.

Barrio de Jalatlaco
Jalatlaco is a slice of neighborhood along the northeast edge of Centro Histórico, staying south of the road Niños Heroes de Chapultepec.

Barrio de Xochimilco (and La Cascada)
This quiet hood lies just north of the road Niños Heroes de Chapultepec, along the west side of Río San Felipe.

Colonia Reforma
Reforma is an upscale hood that sites across from Xochimilco, to the east of Río San Felipe, and north of Niños Heroes de Chapultepec.
